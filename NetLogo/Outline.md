Outline of Netlogo Model(s):
Model 1: Raceway_Model
Model 2: Lab_Sim_Model
	

Plan for Raceway_Model:

	• 5 inputs:
		• Strain
		• Nitrogen
		• Light
		• Salinity
		• Temperature
	• >= 3 outputs:
		• FAME as Lipids
		• Biomass as Biomass
		• FAME% as Lipid%
		• ?
		• ?
	• n Graphs:
		• Biomass as Biomass Levels
		• FAME% as Lipid%
			• Temperature and Salinity as Enviroment
			• Light as Light Levels
			• Nitrogen as Nitrogen Levels
		•Last 3 could be combined as possible
