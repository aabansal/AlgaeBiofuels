## WHAT IS IT?

This model explores the growth of algae and the production of lipids for the eventual creation of green crude and/or biofuels based on certain environmental factors. 
The default option upon opening is to model for biomass growth, and has an option where you can change it to model lipid production.

## HOW IT WORKS
 
 
 The model models the accumulation of biomass in a raceway pond with a size 3.5 m by 1.5 m and 35 cm in depth (1025 L nominal volume at 25 cm working depth, with a surface area of 4.2 m<sup>2</sup> including the paddlewheel area), with a variety of factors that can be influenced by the user, with the algae strain being  KA32 - _Nannochloropsis_ _Oceanica_ â€“ Cellana, or LRB-AZ-1201 - _Chlorella_ _Vulgaris_ - Arizona State University.




## HOW TO USE IT

 Two main buttons are used to control the model:

SETUP: Run this once you have set all the settings as described below, it resets all backend code and clears outputs. **_BEFORE_ _YOU_ _RUN_ _THIS,_ _MAKE SURE_ _TO_ _SAVE_ _ANY_ _GRAPHS_ _YOU_ _WANT_.**

**_START_**: Use this to run the model simulation. **_MAKE_ _SURE_ _TO_ _RUN_ _SETUP_ _FIRST_**, or the model will not run at all, as non-first attempts may function improperly on first run.

There are Five inputs you can choose to manipulate:

  - **The most important of these** is **_Strain_**.

    - If set to  KA32 - Nannochloropsis Oceanica, the model will use corelation data for KA32, the main data points in the raceway dataset used.

    - If set to LRB-AZ-1201 - Chlorella Vulgaris, the model will use correlation data for LRB-AZ-1201, the secondary set of data points in the raceway dataset used.

  - **_Salinity_**, used to set the salinity of the pond for the entire run, in g/L.
	- This is assumed to stay close to constant during the cultivation run, and as such, changeing this variable during the run will have no effect, as it it is set to a hidden constant at the beginning of each run, and will not change unless the **_Setup_** command is run, reseting the model.

  - **_Initial-Nitrogen_**, how much nitrogen is added to the pond at the beginning of the cultivation, in mg/L.
   - Nitrogen is consumed at a rate proportional to the level of biomass, starting at the amount chosen by **_Initial-Nitrogen_**.

  - **_Tempetature_**, the temperature of the water in the pond, in degrees Celcius.
	- This is assumed to stay close to constant during the cultivation run, and as such, changeing this variable during the run will have no effect, as it it is set to a hidden constant at the beginning of each run, and will not change unless the **_Setup_** command is run, reseting the model.
	
  - **_Photosynthetically-Active-Radiation_**, the light level of the pond during cultivation, in umol*m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>
	- This is assumed to stay close to constant during the cultivation run, and as such, changeing this variable during the run will have no effect, as it it is set to a hidden constant at the beginning of each run, and will not change unless the **_Setup_** command is run, reseting the model.
	- It is actually an 24 hour average, which is why we are assuming it will stay close to constant.


## THINGS TO NOTICE

- Think about if the output make sense, for example, when nitrogen is lower, lipids should be higher. If you do not see that, why?
- Think about what should have an effect. Do some research, does what you find online match with what you see, why or why not?
- What causes the pond to crash/stop working?

## THINGS TO TRY

- Try moving sliders to extremes
- Try setting all values close to each other
- Try to cause a quick pond crash

## EXTENDING THE MODEL

- Figure out how to plot other variables, and plot ones that you think might be important

## NETLOGO FEATURES

- The model uses large and stacked IF queries
- The model relies heavily on stocks and Systems Dynamics, rewritten by hand to allow it to work in NetLogo Web
