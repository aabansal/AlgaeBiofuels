some of these may have been gotten already, but i don't have them anymore (lost the document where i was storing them),
and i want to have a single file with all correlations listed in the final output, in case i ever need to fix issues with the model(s)


Needed correlations for raceway model:
	• KA32:
		• Biomass: 
			• PAR
			• Temperature
			• Nitrogen
			• Salinity
		• Lipid:
			• PAR -done
			• Temperature
			• Nitrogen
			• Salinity
		• Nitrogen consumption from Biomass Level
	• LRB:
		• Biomass: 
			• PAR
			• Temperature
			• Nitrogen
			• Salinity
		• Lipid:
			• PAR
			• Temperature
			• Nitrogen
			• Salinity
		• Nitrogen consumption from Biomass Level

Needed correlations for lab model:
	•Biomass:
		• Replete
		• Starvation
		• Resupplementation
	•Lipid:
		• Replete
		• Starvation
		• Resupplementation (maybe two parts, decrease then increase?)
	• Nitrogen consumption from Biomass Level
