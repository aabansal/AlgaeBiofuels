Part 2: Integrating Algal Starvation

Background:
The data analyzed in the previous walk through from the ATP-3 was collected in a real world scenario. The majority of variables were not controlled, and instead tracked over a period of time in each pond. The algae were cultivated semi-continuously, meaning the pond was drained 25% three times per week or 75% once per week depending on which experiment was being carried out (Knoshaug). Additionally, the algae were cultivated in raceway ponds- a system open to its environment. Three different strains of algae were grown in different locations ranging from Hawaii to Arizona. These characteristics allowed us to analyze data across different species, locations, and environmental factors. However, what if we want to isolate a certain aspect of algal growth and include it in our model? For that, we would want to analyze the algal strain in a lab and control every variable so that we can isolate the aspect we want to understand.  We will simulate this by using data from a study carried out by scientists from the Baliga Lab at ISB. 
This study focused on analyzing gene expression in a model algae that "produces lipids during nutrient stress" (Green Algae Biofuels). Each and every variable was controlled precisely. Through the analysis of this data, we want to derive the growth rate of algae biomass and lipid production during starvation periods to integrate strategic starvation into our Netlogo model.

Nitrogen Starvation:
Follow the same process as before, except instead of opening project walkthrough, open GoogleColab/Nitrogen_Starvation_Walkthrough.ipynb. Read through the code and play around with different relationships. Note that this lab data is very clean and controlled so many of the steps we previously used to clean up the data are no longer needed. Look through the significant relationships you found using the heat map in our previous walk through and see if you can figure out what is happening in each of the graphs.
