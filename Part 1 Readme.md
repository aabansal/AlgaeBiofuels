Part 1: Raceway Pond Data

Introduction:
For this project, we used a data set from a study conducted by The Algae Testbed Public-Private Partnership (ATP-3) that measured several different factors to see how they affected lipid production in algae.  This study was an observational study done over multiple years in multiple different locations "with the goal of investigating open pond algae cultivation across different geographic, climatic, seasonal, and operational conditions"  (Knoshaug).  Aside from the fact that it was not a controlled environment, there were many missing values and a lot of calibration issues when taking the measurements. While it was accurate, we knew it would be a lot of work to break it apart and convert it into a format that would be easy to read and to work with.
As a reference, this is the research presentation page for the original study (you do not need to read the entire article to complete this activity).
Getting Started:
Now we will walk you through the process we went through to analyze the data. 
First, you will be opening up the Jupyter Notebook which has all the code we used to clean and analyze the data. Go to http://colab.research.google.com and find the GitHub tab [from Danielle (I can't figure out how to comment): maybe providing screenshots would make this more clear?). 
(comment, it may be just me but I struggled to find the GitHub tab, maybe you could specify what its full name is and what we are meant to do with it, because afterwards we just search for the github url anyway- Natalia)
Search for this URL: https://github.com/aabansal/AlgaeBiofuels and open up the file GoogleColab/Project_Walkthrough.ipynb.
Complete the walk through and follow the process to see if you can understand what each block of code is doing.  Note any significant graphs or correlations you find.
